a. Database: International Investment Position Statistics (IMF DATA)
b. Information: This daata is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value of financial assets of residens of an economy
that are claims on nonresidents or are gold bullion held as reserve assets, and the liabilities of residents of an economy to nonresidents.
The difference between the assets and liabilities is the net position in the IIP and represents either a net claim on or a net liability to
the rest of the world.  
c. Interest: It's interesting to study further how people's geographic position and the relationship between their country and other can
affect their investments. This data shows the distribution of investments in each country, such as direct investment, portfolio investment, 
reserve assets, among others.
